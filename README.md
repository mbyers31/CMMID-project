# CMMID-project
A repository for our final project for Computational and Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

## About This Project
For this project we will explore the different ways that variable vaccination rates among a structured population affects the spread of disease. We plan to incorporate the dynamics of vaccine adoption and waning immunity after vaccination as well.
