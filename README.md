# CMMID-project
A repository for our final project for Computational and Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases.

## About This Project
For this project we will explore the different ways that variable vaccination rates among a structured population affects the spread of disease. We plan to incorporate the dynamics of vaccine adoption and waning immunity after vaccination as well.

## About the Data
We pulled our data from several different sources, which are cited in our final paper. Some of the data are too large to upload to this repository. We provide a list of those data below:
1. [Our World in Data Coronavirus data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data)
2. [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Coronavirus vaccination trends by age and sex](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccination-Age-and-Sex-Trends-in-the-Uni/5i5k-6cmh/about_data)
3. [Replication data from "Quantifying population contact patterns in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic" by Feehan and Mahmud, 2020.](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/M74AJ4)
